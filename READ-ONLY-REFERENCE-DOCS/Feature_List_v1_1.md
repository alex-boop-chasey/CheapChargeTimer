### Feature 1 – Cheap Charge Time Alerts

**What it does**  

Connects to your home or work electricity pricing so you can see exactly when power is cheapest, receive alerts for those times, and track how much money you save by charging during low-cost periods.  
During onboarding, you select your electricity supplier after granting location access. The app pulls your tariff pricing, highlights the cheapest charging windows, sends alerts when those times arrive, and logs your savings after charging by comparing against the highest price in that 24-hour period.

**Real-life scenario**  

You arrive home in the evening and open the ChargeTimerPro app to check when electricity will be cheapest based on your power plan. The app shows that charging later that night will cost much less so you set a reminder for the next cheap charging time. When the cheap charging slot alert arrives, you begin charging. After charging finishes, the app shows how much money you saved compared to charging at the most expensive time that day.

**One-sentence lock for Feature 1**  

Cheap Charge Time Alerts shows you when electricity is cheapest for your specific power plan, alerts you when those times arrive, and tracks how much money you save by charging then.

### Feature 2 – Charger Map

**What it does**  

Shows nearby public EV chargers on a map, with filters for charger type and speed, live availability where supported, and simple reliability indicators based on recent successful use. This helps you choose chargers that are more likely to be working when you arrive.  
The feature is designed to reduce guesswork by highlighting chargers that are usable right now, not just chargers that exist on paper.

**Real-life scenario**  

You’re away from home and need to charge your car before continuing your trip. You open the Charger Map in the ChargeTimerPro app and see several nearby charging locations.  
Instead of choosing the closest one blindly, you select a charger that shows recent successful use and available spots. You drive there, start charging, and avoid the frustration of arriving at a charger that is out of order or already full.

**One-sentence lock for Feature 2**  

Charger Map helps you find public chargers that are nearby, available, and more likely to work when you get there.

### Feature 3 – Savings Tracker

**What it does**  

Tracks how much money you save by charging during cheaper electricity periods and presents those savings in a clear, easy-to-understand way. Savings are calculated by comparing what you paid to charge against what it would have cost at the highest electricity price within the same 24-hour period.  
The Savings Tracker automatically logs savings after each charging session and allows you to view totals by day, week, month, or year, making it easy to see both short-term and long-term benefits.

**Real-life scenario**  

At the end of the day, you open the ChargeTimerPro app and check the Savings Tracker to see how much you saved by charging during low-cost hours. Later in the week, you switch the view to weekly savings and notice how those small daily savings have added up.  
At the end of the month, you view your monthly total and clearly see the financial benefit of choosing cheaper charging times, reinforcing that smarter charging decisions make a real difference to your power bill.

**One-sentence lock for Feature 3**  

Savings Tracker shows how much money you save by charging at cheaper times, with totals you can view by day, week, month, or year.

### Feature 4 – Apple Integration

**What it does**  

Integrates ChargeTimerPro with Apple features like Home Screen widgets, Siri, Shortcuts, and Live Activities so charging and battery information is always visible without needing to open the app.  
You can create custom Home Screen widget configurations that show the information most important to you, while Live Activities display time-sensitive charging updates directly on the Lock Screen and disappear automatically when they’re no longer needed.

**Real-life scenario**  

During the day, you see one of the custom Home Screen widgets you set up on your iPhone showing when the next cheap charging time is coming up. Later in the evening, a Live Activity appears on your Lock Screen showing a countdown to the next cheap charging period.  
When charging starts, the Live Activity updates to show charging progress. Once charging finishes, it updates one final time and then disappears, keeping your Lock Screen clean without any extra action from you.  
At any time, you can also ask Siri for charging-related information without opening the app.

**One-sentence lock for Feature 4**  

Apple Integration uses widgets, Siri, Shortcuts, and Live Activities to surface charging and battery information in the places you already look on your iPhone.

### Feature 5 – Battery Alerts

**What it does**  

Monitors your car’s reported battery level and combines it with distance to home, work, and nearby reliable public chargers to provide early, practical alerts.  
Instead of relying on battery percentage alone, Battery Alerts estimate whether your remaining charge is sufficient to return to a familiar location or comfortably reach a known, reliable public charger. If an initial alert is ignored, the app follows up with clearer guidance based on your remaining battery and reachable charging options.  

These alerts are designed to support calm decision-making and prevent battery anxiety, without creating unnecessary urgency.

**Real-life scenario**  

While driving during the day, you receive an early notification letting you know that, based on your current battery level and distance, you have enough charge to return home or to work, but may want to plan your next charge soon.  
The alert presents two clear options: returning home to charge, or continuing your trip and choosing from a list of reliable public chargers that your remaining battery can comfortably reach. You decide which option suits your plans, adjust accordingly, and continue driving without stress or urgency.

**One-sentence lock**  

Battery Alerts combine battery level with distance to home, work, and reliable chargers to warn you early and guide you toward safe charging options.

### Feature 6 – AutoCharge

**What it does**  

Automatically starts and stops charging using compatible smart home-connected chargers and devices, based on the cheapest charging times identified by the app.  
AutoCharge connects to supported smart home platforms (starting with Google Home) to control compatible chargers or smart power devices. Once enabled, it handles charging timing for you by switching charging on during low-cost periods and off when charging is complete or when the cheap period ends.  

AutoCharge is designed to work with existing compatible charging setups, without requiring manual reminders or late-night intervention.

**Real-life scenario**  

You know electricity will be cheapest later that night, but you don’t want to manage charging manually. You enable AutoCharge and link your supported smart home account.  
Later, when the cheap charging period begins, AutoCharge automatically starts charging through your connected charger or smart device. When charging finishes or the low-cost period ends, charging stops automatically.  

By morning, your car is charged at the lowest cost, without you needing to check the time or interact with the charger.

**One-sentence lock**  

AutoCharge uses compatible smart home-connected charging devices to automatically start and stop charging during the cheapest electricity periods.

### Feature 7 – Trip Confidence

**What it does**  

Helps you understand whether your current battery level is sufficient for a planned trip using real battery data, distance, and known charging locations.  

Trip Confidence focuses on clarity, not navigation. Instead of giving turn-by-turn directions, it answers a simpler and more important question: can you make this trip comfortably, or should you plan a charge along the way?  

The feature evaluates your starting battery level against the distance of your trip and highlights whether charging is recommended before departure or during the journey.

**Real-life scenario**  

Before heading out for a longer drive, you open ChargeTimerPro and check Trip Confidence. The app shows that your current battery level is enough to reach your destination, but not enough to comfortably return without charging.  

It also highlights a few reliable charging locations along the route where a short stop would remove any uncertainty. With that knowledge, you leave knowing what to expect, instead of hoping the battery will be enough.

**One-sentence lock**  

Trip Confidence helps you know whether your battery is enough for a planned trip and whether charging should be planned along the way.

### Feature 8 – Family / Fleet Multi-Vehicle Awareness

**What it does**  

Provides proactive battery and charging notifications across multiple vehicles so families or work fleets can coordinate charging decisions early and calmly.  

The feature combines each vehicle’s battery level with distance to home, work, and reliable public chargers, and notifies trusted contacts only when additional awareness or coordination may help avoid future charging issues.  
Notifications are shared intentionally and only when useful, helping people support each other without unnecessary interruptions.

**Real-life scenario**  

A parent is linked to their child’s vehicle in ChargeTimerPro. While the child is out driving, the app determines that planning a charge soon would be sensible.  

The parent receives a notification explaining that the car still has enough battery to return home or reach several reliable public chargers. They pass along the information, and charging is handled early and smoothly.  

In a work setting, the same feature helps teams coordinate charging for shared vehicles before it affects schedules or productivity.

**One-sentence lock**  

Family / Fleet Multi-Vehicle Awareness sends shared battery and charging notifications across multiple vehicles to help people coordinate charging decisions early.
