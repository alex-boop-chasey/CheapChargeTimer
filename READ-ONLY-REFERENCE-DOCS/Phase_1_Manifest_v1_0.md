- It may elaborate or describe implementation, process, or delivery details for **canonical product features** only.

## 1. Purpose

This document formally declares **Cheap Charge Timer** as the **official Phase 1 delivery** of ChargeTimerPro.

Cheap Charge Timer is a **Phase 1 extraction**, not a new product in terms of feature innovation or scope. It exists as a **fully standalone app** to deliver immediate, complete user value while remaining fully compatible with the complete ChargeTimerPro system.

---

## 2. Phase 1 Feature Scope

Cheap Charge Timer implements **only** the following canonical features:

| Feature ID | Feature Name |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Cheap Charge Time Alerts |
| 3 | Savings Tracker |
| 6 | AutoCharge (subscription-gated) |

No other features are included, simulated, partially implemented, or implied.

---

## 3. Distribution Note

Cheap Charge Timer may be distributed under an **alternate App Store product name** while remaining the **canonical Phase 1 implementation** of these features.

- While derived from ChargeTimerPro’s canonical features, Cheap Charge Timer operates as an **independent, standalone app** in Phase 1, suitable for separate App Store submission and user adoption.

This does not alter feature identity, intent, or scope.

---

## 4. Phase Discipline

- Phase 1 must provide complete, honest standalone value
- Phase 1 must not depend on Phase 2 capabilities
- Phase 2 integration must occur via **additive composition**, not reinterpretation

---

## 5. Authority Statement

All feature definitions, boundaries, and behaviors are inherited verbatim from:
- Feature_List_v1_1.md
- Data_Sources_and_Truth_Model_v1_0.md
- ChargeTimerPro Constitution v1.3
