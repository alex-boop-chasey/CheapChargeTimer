# CHARGE TIMER PRO CONSTITUTION v1.3  
Highest law of the project · Durable, minimal, and binding

# Governance Clause
This document is governed by **ChargeTimerPro Constitution v1.3** and **Feature_List_v1_0.md**.
- It may elaborate or describe implementation, process, or design details for **canonical product features** only.
- It must not add, remove, subdivide, or redefine any **product feature scope**.
- It must not introduce new **product features, user flows, or capabilities** outside the canonical feature list.
- Any conflict with the Constitution or Feature List is invalid — **the Constitution prevails**.

## 1. Core Mission
Help EV owners charge at the lowest possible cost and avoid battery-related stress through clear, trustworthy guidance.

---

## 2. Canonical Feature Authority
ChargeTimerPro is defined by a fixed set of features.

The **canonical list, identity, and intent** of those features are defined in:
`Feature_List_v1_0.md`

This file establishes **what features exist**, not how they are built.

---

## 3. Scope Lock
The project is permanently constrained by the canonical feature set.

- No functionality may exist outside the features defined in `Feature_List_v1_0.md`
- Features may be elaborated, implemented, or documented in other files
- No document may expand, subdivide, or redefine feature scope beyond the original intent without a new Constitution version

The Constitution governs *what may exist*.  
Supporting documents govern *how it is built*.

---

## 4. Shipping Reality
The project may be delivered in phases to ensure it ships and remains maintainable.

- Early phases must provide complete, standalone value
- Later features may be delayed or gated
- Early architecture must not prevent later features defined in the feature list

---

## 5. Truthfulness Invariant
ChargeTimerPro may only present information or take actions supported by real, defensible data.

The app must never:
- Simulate certainty where none exists
- Invent or exaggerate vehicle, charger, or energy state
- Mislead users through implication, omission, or overconfidence

Uncertainty must be revealed, not hidden.

---

## 6. Calm-by-Design Rule
The app must never rely on fear, urgency, or alarmism to influence user behavior.

All guidance must:
- Encourage early, calm decisions
- Preserve user autonomy
- Reduce anxiety rather than amplify it

Battery awareness is guidance, not panic.

---

## 7. Non-Surveillance Principle
ChargeTimerPro is not a tracking product.

The app must not:
- Continuously monitor or record movement
- Collect data unrelated to user benefit
- Expose location or vehicle state without clear, user-aligned purpose

All data use must be minimal, intentional, and respectful.

---

## 8. Architectural Permanence
Early technical decisions must not permanently limit the system.

Architecture must preserve:
- Extensibility
- Replaceability
- Long-term coherence

Short-term convenience must never override long-term capability.

---

## 9. Monetisation Constraint
Value exchange must remain honest and simple.

- Early versions must provide genuine standalone value
- Advanced capabilities may be monetised as a clear, unified upgrade
- No ads, dark patterns, or manipulative design are permitted

---

## 10. Authority of This Document
This Constitution is the highest governing document of the project.

If any document, plan, or decision conflicts with this file, **this file prevails**.

No changes are permitted without a new version and explicit re-signing.
